# Don't Get Slimed

***

## Game Description 
A 2D retro inspired Genshin Impact game, focusing  on one goal, killing slimes. Players are given a sword and a shield, and forced to fight against oncoming slimes to their death. Dodge against the falling slimes, and kill all the remaining slimes.

## How to Play / Score Points 
Use A,D or  LEFT / RIGHT ARROW KEYS to move the player Left or Right. Moving in  a specific direction causes the character to face that direction. Left Click your sword to swing it at attacking slimes in the direction you're facing. Right Click to bring out a small shield! BE CAREFUL, while the shield blocks one direction, your back is STILL exposed! 

Killing a Slime causes a new one version of that slime to spawn, with a maximum of 6 slimes on the screen, 2x Large Slimes, 1x Falling slime, 3x Small Slimes. Different slimes have different statistics, and awards different things when killed.  Small slimes slowly slide across the floor towards the player. Large Slimes roll across 
the ground, but due to being fat they can barely move. Falling Slimes jump from the ground, off the screen, before falling down fast towards the ground. Falling slimes 
cannot be blocked, only hit before they collide with the groundâ€¦or you.
